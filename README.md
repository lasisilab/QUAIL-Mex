**Study**: Perception of Water Insecurity and Epigenetic Signatures of Stress Among Urban Adult Women

**Study overview**: This research project investigates the relationship between perceived water insecurity, psychological stress, and biological markers of stress among adult women. The study focuses on understanding the impact of water access challenges, emotional responses to water insecurity, and potential biological stress indicators like DNA methylation on stress related genes, and hair cortisol levels. 

**Location**: Iztapalapa, Mexico City, Mexico
